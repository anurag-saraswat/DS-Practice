## Array and Vectors
1. Pairs :Given an array containing N integers, and an number S denoting a target sum. Find two distinct integers that can pair up to form target sum. 

2. Triplets : Given an array containing N integers and a number S denoting a target sum.Find all distinct integers that can add up to form target sum. The number in each triplet shpuld be orderd ascending order and triplet sould be ordered 
to. Return empty array if no. such triplet exists.

3. Mountain : Write a function that takes input an array of distinct integers and returns the length of highest mountain. A mountain is defined as adjacent integers that are strictly increasing until they reach apeak at which it becomes strictly decreasing. Atleast 3 no. are required to form mountain.

4. Longest Band : Given an array containing N integers, find length of longest band. Band is defined as a subsequence which can be reordered in such a manner all element appear consecutive(i.e with absolute difference of 1 between meighbouring elements). A longest band is the band(subsequence) which contains maximum integers.

5. Rains : Given n non-negative integers representing an elevation map where width of each bar is 1, compute how much water it can trap after raining.
